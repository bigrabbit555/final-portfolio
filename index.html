        <h1>UI/UX Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a junior at Brown University studying computer science.  While I generally steer clear from frontend design and development as much as possible, I stepped out of my comfort zone this semester by taking <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1300/" target="_blank">CSCI 1300: UI/UX</a>.  The purpose of this page as a culmination of the course is to highlight all I've learned about user interfaces and user experience, and to show off some of the my best work.</p>
        <p>I feel that the simplest design is often the best, and am proud of the balance I believe I've struck between simplicity and style.  So please feel free to take a look at the projects I've chosen to include below, and one way or another I hope you leave with some new thoughts about design.</p>
