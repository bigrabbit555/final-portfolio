        <h1>UI/UX Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a junior at Brown University studying computer science.  While I've historically steered clear of front end design and development, I stepped out of my comfort zone this semester by taking <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1300/" target="_blank">CSCI 1300: UI/UX</a>.  The purpose of this page as a culmination of the course is to highlight all I've learned about user interfaces and user experience (as well as all I've yet to learn) and to show off some of the my best work.</p>
        <p>I feel that the simplest design is often the best, and am proud of the balance I've struck between simplicity and style to deliver designs that are easy and pleasant to use.  So please feel free to take a look at the projects I've chosen to include below, and one way or another I hope you leave with some new thoughts about design.</p>
