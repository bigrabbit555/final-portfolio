        <h1>Development</h1>
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Having spent so much time trying to empathize with the user and considering what makes for good design, this project sought to shift gears and place a greater emphasis on the actual implementing the some of the actual functionality that a user might expect from an interface.  Using React, students were asked to develop a web app with some number of "items" which could be filtered, sorted, and aggregated in various capacities.</p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>First off, I decided to make a site for users to browse various cats available for sale (or perhaps adoption?) and add them to a cart.  This choice was primarily driven by the fact that cats are silly little fellas and I knew it would be more fun to come up with pretend cats than pastries.  Each cat has a name, age, price, and a set of descriptive tags that apply to them.  My goal was to allow users to filter by price and age by inputting an acceptable range, as well as by tags by checking off all the tags that they wanted their cat to have.  I also planned to allow users to sort by price, so they can find the cheapest cats matching their criteria, and finally to add cats to their cart, which also tracks the total price they've accumulated to avoid going over budget.</p>
        <p>To take best advantage of the React framework, I made use of state to track user inputs and update the cart and displayed cats as needed.  Each sort criteria has the appropriate type and number of input fields, and for sorting by price there are buttons for ascending and descending.  Each of these also has an option to remove that filter, returning to the previous state.  These buttons when pressed update the corresponding state variables, prompting React to automatically re-render all the kitties on display with whatever new criteria (or lack thereof).  The Cart functions similarly, with each kitty having a button to add it to the cart that updates both the contents of the cart and the total price in their state variable forms, which in turn leads React to re-render the on-screen cart with the updated values.</p>
        <h2>The Final Product</h2>
        <p>I implore you to take a peek at the final product <a href="https://bigrabbit555.github.io/cs1300-development" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Looking back on this project, I think the user interface could definitely use some work from an aesthetic point of view; I largely stuck with the default text fields, buttons, and other components due to simplicity and the fact that functionality was my main priority.  I do think that the interface is intuitive and well laid out, somewhat consistently with other online shopping interfaces with a means to search/filter/sort at the top, the results displayed below, and a cart on the right side.  Functional items inputs and outputs alike are clearly labeled, and do in fact update as needed to meet the criteria of the project, so all in all I'm happy with how this turned out.</p>
